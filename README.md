Overview of my smart home journey

# Key Criteria

Early on I established the following criteria

- Prioritise Local Integrations - not tied to the cloud/internet connectivity
- Intuitive for guests


# Installation:


# Usage:

**NOTE: since v.2.0.x, the tokenset.json file is no longer needed because the integration can connect and retrieve the tokens autonomously. When installing v.2.0.x from a previous one, the integration must be deleted and re-added.**

The integration can be configured in two ways:

# 1. Services

* Gas
* Electric

**Services To Do:**

* Water

# 2. Security

Comprising of:
* Cameras
* Home Alarm System
